# Make Change Project - Homework Project 1


### Description
This project is a cash register that takes an submitted price, and determines the correct amount of change in US currency,

### Lessons Learned
- Reinforcement of Order of Operations: Setting up the equation lines to sort bills and coins was difficult to comprehend at first. Reciting PEMDAS helped me solve the "countless" issues I faced counting change.
- Formatting Output with printf(): I learned a small bit of formatting using this, for example (%.2f%n) I did not set width only the length of two.
- Make it look good: I learned to make the console output look good for the user, even in a small way. In the end its about customer satisfaction right?
